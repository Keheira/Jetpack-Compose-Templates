# Jetpack Compose Templates
JC doesn't have templates that I can use on start so here are my versions. Click the project name to go directly to that folder.

## Templates

### [Bottom Navigation](https://github.com/Keheira/Jetpack-Compose-Templates/tree/main/BottomNavigation)
Simple Bottom Navigation view with 5 sub-screens. I picked 5 screens because that is the standard "maximum" seen in most mobile applications.

### [Splash Screen](https://github.com/Keheira/Jetpack-Compose-Templates/tree/main/SplashScreen)
**Still in progress**
Show a splash screen on application start.

### [Login Flow](https://github.com/Keheira/Jetpack-Compose-Templates/tree/main/LoginFlow)
Simple login view with registration to dimonstrate nested navigation.

## For Fun

### [Timer]()
Simple timer application. When you hit the "start" button the time starts incrementing and you will see the button switch to "stop". When you hit "stop", you will see the option to "continue" or "reset" the timer.

### [Text Pass]()
Pass text entered on screen 1 to screen 2. This demonstrates navigation and the use of `rememberSaveable`.

### [SDK Example](https://github.com/Keheira/Jetpack-Compose-Templates/tree/main/SDKExample)
Writing a simple library and using it within an app.

Start working with state, layouts, and theming in jetpack compose. Everything is in a single file which isn't standard but still give you a good start on understanding the basics of declaritive UI.
